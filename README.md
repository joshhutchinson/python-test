python-test
===========

This is a repository made solely for the purpose of testing python and learn as I go with GitHub.  Python's a strong
language to code with, and can have potentially limitless possibilities.  Harnessing that strength to create easy to use code that performs efficiently and effectively is what my end goal is with this project, and have fun doing it in the process.
